## Frontend Enhancements

### Product Management

I've implemented comprehensive product management features on the frontend, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete products seamlessly.

#### Components

- **ProductList**
  - **Path:** `app/components/track-one/ProductList.tsx`
  - **Description:** Displays a paginated list of products with options to edit or delete each product.
- **ProductForm**
  - **Path:** `app/components/track-one/ProductForm.tsx`
  - **Description:** A modal form that facilitates the creation of new products and editing of existing ones.

#### State Management

Utilized [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for efficient state management.

- **Store**
  - **Path:** `app/store/productStore.ts`
  - **Functions:**
    - `setProducts`: Sets the list of products.
    - `addProduct`: Adds a new product to the store.
    - `updateProduct`: Updates an existing product in the store.
    - `deleteProduct`: Removes a product from the store.

#### Custom Hooks

- **useFetchProducts**
  - **Path:** `app/hooks/useFetchProducts.ts`
  - **Description:** Fetches products from the backend API and updates the global state. Handles loading and error states.

### Search and Sort Functionality

Enhancements to the `ProductList` component now include:

- **Search**
  - Users can search products by name using the search input field.
- **Sort**
  - Products can be sorted by `Name`, `Price`, or `ID` in both ascending and descending order.

### Pagination

Implemented pagination to improve the user experience when dealing with large datasets.

- **Features:**
  - **Items Per Page:** Displays 10 products per page.
  - **Navigation Controls:** Provides "Previous" and "Next" buttons to navigate through pages.
  - **Current Page Indicator:** Shows the current page number out of the total pages.

### Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**
  - Components such as `ProductList` and `ProductForm` are lazy-loaded to reduce the initial load time of the application.
- **Code Splitting**
  - Implemented code splitting to ensure that only necessary code is loaded, enhancing performance and scalability.

### User Interface Improvements

- **TailwindCSS Integration**
  - Leveraged TailwindCSS for a responsive and modern design.
- **Reusable UI Components**
  - Developed reusable UI components like `Button` for consistency and efficiency across the application.

### API Integration

Seamless integration with the backend API for all CRUD operations.

- **Endpoints:**

  - `GET /api/product`: Retrieve all products.
  - `POST /api/product`: Create a new product.
  - `PUT /api/product/:id`: Update an existing product.
  - `DELETE /api/product/:id`: Delete a product.

- **Implementation:**
  - Utilized `fetch` API within React components and custom hooks to interact with the backend.
  - Handled API responses and errors gracefully, providing feedback to users.
