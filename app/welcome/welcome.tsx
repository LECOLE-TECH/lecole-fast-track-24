					<TrackCard
						title="Welcome to LECOLE Fast Track Challenge"
						description="Welcome to the LECOLE Fast Track Challenge! This challenge consists of three tracks designed to assess your web development skills using React. Each track will focus on a different aspect of development—from basic frontend integration to performance optimization. You’ll have 10 days to complete all the tracks. Best of luck!"
					/>

					<TrackCard
						title="Track One: Frontend Integration Challenge"
						description="In this track, you will integrate the frontend with a pre-built backend API. The API is already set up with product data, and your task is to implement the frontend that interacts with it. You'll need to create a user-friendly interface that allows full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for the products."
						requirements={[
							"Write clean, readable, and maintainable code",
							"Use React hooks correctly (e.g., useState, useEffect)",
							"Structure components in a reusable way",
							"Ensure a user-friendly UI/UX design",
						]}
						features={[
							"Integrate with a pre-built backend API for products",
							"Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)",
							"Develop reusable frontend components",
							"Implement state management for handling product data",
							"Follow best API integration patterns",
						]}
					/>

					<TrackCard
						title="Track Two: React RBAC"
						description="In this track, you’ll focus on implementing a React application with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). The app will include a list of users with roles and secret phrases. Your task is to implement real-time updates using sockets, ensure data is loaded efficiently, and securely."
						requirements={[
							"Write clean, readable, and maintainable code",
							"Properly use React hooks for performance optimization",
							"Structure components in a way that is easy to maintain",
							"Ensure the UI/UX is intuitive and user-friendly",
						]}
						features={[
							"Implement an input field for usernames",
							"Create provider-based access for different user roles (non-authenticated, authenticated, and admin users)",
							"Non-authenticated users can only see the list of username",
							"Authenticated users can see the list of username and their roles. They can also update their secret phrase",
							"Admin users can see all of the information of all users, and can update the secret phrase of any user",
							"Display all of the data in a table format",
							"Use sockets to keep user data updated in real-time",
							"Ensure data is efficiently loaded and rendered",
						]}
					/>

					<TrackCard
						title="Track Three: Local-First Todo Board"
						description="Build a Trello-like todo board application that prioritizes local-first operations while maintaining backend synchronization. The application should primarily work with local storage and attempt to sync with the backend. For bonus points, implement offline functionality where the app continues to work without a backend and syncs when connectivity is restored."
						requirements={[
							"Write clean, readable, and maintainable code",
							"Implement proper error handling for backend connectivity issues",
							"Structure components for optimal performance",
							"Ensure smooth user experience during sync operations",
						]}
						features={[
							"Create a drag-and-drop interface for managing todos across three columns",
							"Implement local SQLite storage using WASM",
							"Fetch and merge backend changes every 15 seconds",
							"Visual indicators for sync status (yellow = pending, green = synced)",
							"Three status columns: Backlog, In Progress, and Done",
							"Smooth animations for drag and drop interactions",
							"(Advanced) Full offline support - continue working without backend",
							"(Advanced) Conflict resolution when syncing offline changes",
							"(Advanced) Network status detection and automatic sync resume",
						]}
					/>

					<TrackCard
						title="Bonus Points"
						description="These additional features will enhance your submission and improve performance and user experience."
						features={[
							"Implement code splitting and lazy loading for faster page loads",
							"Use memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders",
							"Optimize handling of large lists (e.g., virtualize or paginate lists)",
							"Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for long lists",
							"Use a global state management solution (e.g., Redux, Zustand, or Context API)",
							"Write comprehensive tests for your application",
							"Ensure TypeScript is used throughout the project",
							"Document performance optimizations and improvements",
						]}
					/>

					<TrackCard
						title="Deliverables"
						description="Ensure you submit the following items when you complete your project:"
						features={[
							"Fork the GitHub repository and follow the instructions to run the project locally",
							"Deploy the app using a free service like Vercel, GitHub Pages, or Netlify (if possible)",
							"Document the challenges you faced and the solutions you implemented for each track",
							"Submit a Pull Request with your changes to the original repository",
						]}
