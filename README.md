## Challenges

    One of the most challenging aspects of this project was implementing frontend pagination. Determining how many pages should be visible around the current page and deciding when to include ellipses required careful thought and balancing usability with simplicity. I spent more time than anticipated fine-tuning the logic to ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience.
